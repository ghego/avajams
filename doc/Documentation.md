## Motivation

* Soundtrack of your life
* Video is ubiquitous but not easy to add soundrack
* 60 hours of video are uploaded every minute
* in 2016 digital video will reach nearly $5 billion
* Self-Made video mash-up will be big market

## Project Goal for Hackathon

* Find the best matching video clip from a video clip or an image
* Provide groundwork for future improvements

## Methodology

* Extract an image for every second of the video.  The extracted image is in JPG format with a size of 100 x 100.
* Use TensorFlow's Inception to associate the images with 1,000 classifications
* Find the best matching video clip of these images based on cosine similiary matrix
* Bonus Task: Mash-up the matched music with the user provided clip

## Technology Stack

* Pipeline to download lots of videos from youtube
* Preprocessing of videos
* Frames extraction
* Feature extraction using TensorFlow's Inception neural network model
* Cosine similarity with closest video match in our db
* Mashup between uploaded video and videoclip found
* Web app

## Future Improvements
* Train on more videos, at least 10,000 videos to train
* Customize TensorFlow's Inception with new classes
* Better business use cases e.g. better recommender
* Sentiment Analysis based on video/ image color to better match the mood of music a.k.a. style transfer music
